I created a project through Visual Studio 2019. It was through an ASP.NET Core Web App (Model-View-Controller) template.
I explored the defaulty created Models, Views, and Controllers. 
I reviewed the other default files as well, such as the IActionResult that takes me to the various navigations and returns the View.

I experimented with debugging and creating break points at the home controller page.
